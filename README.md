## What is Carburoam?

Carburoam is an open-source built dashboard on top of Python, Streamlit and ‚ù§Ô∏è

It showcase a Data engineering project which :

- retrieve data daily from [data.gouv.fr](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/prix-des-carburants-en-france-flux-instantane-v2-amelioree/)
- load it into a SQLite database

## Developer notes

We run on a [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) backend, with an AWS S3 distant storage to persist
data accross reboot of the Streamlit server.

A more complete overview of the stack is available in my blog post
‚öôÔ∏è [here](https://emilien-foissotte.github.io/posts/posts/2024/05/streamlit-gas-stations/?utm_campaign=GasWebApp)

To manage local and distant environments, it uses an `.ENV` file, which shall contain theses keys :

- GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD : app password for streamlit gmail account
- LOAD_MODE="remote|local" : If remote, need AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
- BUCKET_NAME_STORE: Uri of the bucket where config file is stored, if using remote load mode

## Vulnerability Disclosure

- Network denial of service (DoS or DDoS) tests or other tests that impair access to or damage a system or data
- Physical testing (e.g. office access, open doors, tailgating), social engineering (e.g. phishing, vishing), or any other non-technical vulnerability testing
